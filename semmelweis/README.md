# Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing

## Project Overview

This project revisits one of the landmark events in public health, the discovery of the benefits of handwashing by Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis in 1847. Through data analysis using Python, this project reanalyzes the medical data Semmelweis collected, which led to a significant reduction in childbed fever upon the implementation of handwashing protocols at his hospital.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
  - `Pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
  - `Matplotlib.pyplot`: Data visualization

## Objectives

The goal of this project is to:
- Demonstrate data manipulation skills with pandas.
- Visualize data trends related to the impact of handwashing on patient outcomes.
- Provide insights into historical medical data through modern data science techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the medical records collected by Dr. Semmelweis, which detail birth rates and childbed fever cases in a 19th-century clinic.

## Usage

To explore this analysis:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages (`pandas`, `matplotlib`).
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the analysis and results.

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by a guided project on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com), an online learning platform specialized in data science.
